What I learned from this tutorial: 
  * swiftUI view
  * preview
  * systemName and SF Symbols
  * arrays
  * ?? 0  // (if false, set it to 0) 
  * functions, types, and return values
  * casting types
  * GeometryReader can be used to get width of screen
  * Picker 
  * Extract Subview to lessen repeated code
